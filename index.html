              This simple website briefly details some of my favourite videogame characters to play and why I like playing them.

            <p>
              Maybe you'll pick up these characters too!

           <div id="mirage" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Mirage (Apex Legends)</h2>
             <h3>Brief description</h3>
             <p>
               In Apex Legends, <a href='https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/mirage'>Mirage</a> is known as a trickster, bamboozling his enemies with his team of decoy clones. Ever since his character introduction at the start of Apex Legends' as a game, I was drawn to his 'witty' personality and unique playstyle. 
             </p>
             <h3>Why I like playing him</h3>
            <p>
              The feeling of 'bamboozling' my enemies, tricking them into shooting a holographic decoy brings me so much more joy than just simply eliminating them.
            </p>
             <p>
              Playing Mirage forces you to rely more on your gunplay because other characters in Apex Legends have abilities that simply outclass Mirage, but I personally find this really rewarding because it means that I won with skill rather than reliance on abilities.

           <div id="soraka" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Soraka (League of Legends)</h2>
             <h3>Brief description</h3>
            <p>
              In League of Legends, <a href='https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/champions/soraka/'>Soraka</a> is a support character who relies on her unparalleled healing and her silence crowd-control (which causes enemies to be unable to cast abilities) to protect her allies.
            </p>
             <h3>Why I like playing her</h3>
             <p>
              In League of Legends, enchanter supports like Soraka are typically priority targets for the enemy team to take down. Knowing this, I love acting as bait and an annoying harasser with my damaging/crowd-control abilities, frustrating the enemy to hopefully allow my teammates to clean up the fights and win!
             </p>
             <p>
               Also, I love experiencing those moments when I do my all to heal my teammates just enough to survive the enemy attacks. It can sometimes seem like a thankless job - people are gonna notice the flashy takedowns over the support healing, but it's worth it to see just one teammate thank you for saving their life after the fact.

           <div id="bidoof" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Bidoof (Pokémon)</h2>
             <h3>Brief description</h3>
            <p>
              <a href='https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bidoof_(Pok%C3%A9mon)'>Bidoof</a> is a fan-favourite Pokémon, beloved by the Pokémon community for their cute looks and endearing personality of determination
            </p>
             <h3>Why I like playing them</h3>
             <p>
               My first Pokémon game was Pokémon Diamond, where Bidoof is one of the first Pokémon you can encounter. I fell in love with Bidoof (reasons more or less found above) inspite of its lack of combat power because their simply a friend trying their best!
             </p>
             <p>
               Bidoof has become so well loved that the Pokémon Company has dedicated July 1st as <a href='https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/celebrate-bidoof-day-on-july-1-with-activities-rewards-and-more'>Bidoof Day</a>!
             </p>
             <p>
               They have even made a short film dedicated to Bidoof, called Bidoof's Big Stand

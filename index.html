           <div id="mirage" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Mirage (Apex Legends)</h2>
             <h3>Brief description</h3>
             <p>
               In Apex Legends, <a href='https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/mirage'>Mirage</a> is known as a trickster, bamboozling his enemies with his team of decoy clones. Ever since his character introduction at the start of Apex Legends' as a game, I was drawn to his 'witty' personality and unique playstyle. 
             </p>
             <h3>Why I like playing him</h3>
            <p>
              The feeling of 'bamboozling' my enemies, tricking them into shooting a holographic decoy brings me so much more joy than just simply eliminating them.
            </p>
             <p>
              Playing Mirage forces you to rely more on your gunplay because other characters in Apex Legends have abilities that simply outclass Mirage, but I personally find this really rewarding because it means that I won with skill rather than reliance on abilities.
